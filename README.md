## About Me
Hello! My name is João Gabriel, and I am a technology enthusiast. I am always looking to improve my programming skills; there are few things better than finishing a script and thinking: "Wow, this turned out great." Currently, I am studying **Data Science** at the **Getúlio Vargas Foundation** in Rio de Janeiro, where I live.

## Projects
I have worked in various project areas. I like to be capable of a little bit of everything if possible, and I enjoy opportunities in different languages.

* Financial Dashboard: Made with data taken from the Tiny ERP and Mercado Livre API, using Python, to observe profit margin and revenue;
* Livestock Dashboard: Made through Excel data, extracted using the Openpyxl library, with financial tables of results from rubber trees;

* Clube Adolpho Bloch: As Scrum Master and Product Owner, I was responsible for the structure and planning of the project, as well as helping with the programming;

#### Others
